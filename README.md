# Max3Sat

It is a program that tries to optimize the search for the best solution to the max3sat problem.

At the input we have a file showing how the clauses are grouped. Examples of input files are m3s_5_0.txt, m3s_50_0.txt and m3s_100_0.txt.

The output returns the best solution found in the specified time (the one that satisfies the most clauses).
